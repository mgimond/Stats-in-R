We will focus on the relationship between income and whether or not the county is on the coast.\n\n```{r}\n# Load dataset\ndat <- read.csv(\"http://mgimond.github.io/Stats-in-R/Data/Income_and_education.csv\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\n# Limit the dataset to the two columns of interest\ndf <- select(dat, Coast, Income = Per.capita.income )\ndf\n```\n\nOne approach to exploring this dataset is to see *how* per capita income varies as a function of the county's coastal status (i.e. whether or not the county borders the ocean or not). A t-test statistic could be used to assess if incomes differ between coastal and non-coastal communities.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Coast, y=Income)) + geom_boxplot()\n```\n\nOr, if one wanted to model that relationship, a [categorical regression analysis](regression.html#4_including_categorical_predictor_variables) could be implemented.\n\nBut what if we are interested in flipping the relationship? In other words, what if we wanted to see how the coastal status of a county related to per capita income? More specifically, what if we wanted to see if county level income could predict whether a county is on the coast or not. Visually, this relationship would look like:\n\n```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5, echo=FALSE}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=Coast)) + geom_point(alpha=.5) + xlim(15000,35000)\n```\n\nThis does not look like a *typical* scatter plot one sees in a regression analysis, but the relationship we are exploring is similar in concept--i.e. we are seeking a model of the form `Y = a + bX`. We could, of course, fit a `linear` model to the data as follows:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=as.integer(Coast)-1)) + geom_point(alpha=.5) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"lm\", se=FALSE) + ylab(\"Coast\") + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,1), labels=c(\"no\", \"yes\")) +\n  xlim(15000,35000)\n  \n  \n\nM <- lm(as.integer(Coast) -1 ~ Income, df)\nM.a <- sprintf(\"%0.2g\",coef(M)[1])\nM.b <- sprintf(\"%0.2g\",coef(M)[2])\n```\n\nThe model to the above fit is of the form *Coast = `r M.a` + `r M.b` Income*. Now, you may see a couple of issues with this model. For starters, the model implies that there are `coast` values other than `yes` and `no` (e.g. what does the model return for an income value of $24,000?). In fact, the model is treating `coast` as a numeric value where `no` is coded as `0` (no probability) and `yes` is coded as `1` (maximum probability). This makes sense when you re-frame the question along the lines of *what is the probability that the county is on the coast given the county's median per capita income?*\n\nAnother problem with the above model is that the straight line does a very poor job in *fitting* the data and, if we are treating the `coast` axis as a probability limited to the range of 0 and 1, the model implies that we can have a probability greater than `1` (e.g. and income value of $32,000 suggests a probability of about 1.17). A workaround is to fit a different model--one that is bounded by the minimum and maximum probabilities. Such a shape is called a **logistic curve**.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=as.integer(Coast)-1)) + geom_point(alpha=.5) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE, \n              method.args = list(family=binomial)) + \n  ylab(\"Coast\") + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0,1), labels=c(\"no\", \"yes\")) + xlim(15000,35000)\n\n```\n\n\n\n# The logistic regression model\n\nThe logistic regression model can be presented in one of two ways:\n\n$$\nlog(\\frac{p}{1-p}) = b_0 + b_1 x\n$$\n\nor, solving for `p` (and noting that the `log` in the above equation is the *natural* log) we get,\n\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0 + b_1 x)}}\n$$\n\nwhere `p` is the probability of `y` occurring given a value `x`. In our example this translates to the probability of a county being on the coast given its median per capita income value. In the first equation, fraction $\\frac{p}{1-p}$ is referred to as the **odds ratio** which gives us the odds in favor of a `yes` (or `1` when represented using binomial values). The log of the *odds ratio*, $log(\\frac{p}{1-p})$, is referred to as the **logit**. Note that the probability can be computed from the odds ratio as $\\frac{odds}{1 + odds}$. Note too that there is not error term as is the case with a linear regression model. \n\nWhereas the linear regression parameters are estimated using the least-squares method, the logistic regression model parameters are estimated using the **maximum-likelihood** method. For our dataset, these parameters can be estimated in R using the `glm()` function as follows:\n\n```{r}\nM1 <- glm(Coast ~ Income, df, family = binomial)\nM1\n```\n\nThus, our model looks like:\n\n$$\nP_{coast} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(-12.2 + 0.0005 Income)}}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{coast}$ is the probability of a county being on the coast. To see what the relationship looks like for a range of income values, we can use the `predict()` function as follows:\n\n\n```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\n# Create a range of income values (we'll cover a wider range then the dataset)\n# The range of values must be saved in a data frame and must have the same column\n# name as that given in the original dataset\nM.df       <- data.frame(Income = seq(10000, 40000, 1000))\n\n#Predict the Coast values (as a probability) using the above data\nM.df$Coast <- predict(M1, newdata=M.df, type=\"response\")\n\n# Plot the modeled probability values\nggplot(M.df, aes(x=Income, y=Coast)) + geom_line()\n```\n\nNote how the logistic regression model converted the categorical variable `Coast` into a numeric one by assigning `0` to `no` and `1` to `yes`.\n\nA simpler way to plot the model is to make use of `ggplot`'s `stat_smooth` function. However, this will require that we convert the `Coast` factor to numeric values manually since `ggplot` will not do this for us automatically like `glm`. One quick way to do this is to wrap the `Coast` factor with `as.numeric`:\n\n```{r}\nas.numeric(df$Coast)\n```\n\nInstead of seeing `yes`'s and `no`'s, we now have numbers (`1` and `2`). But which number is mapped to which factor? One easy way to map the levels is to use the `mapLevels` function from the package `gdata`.\n\n```{r}\ngdata::mapLevels(df$Coast)\n```\n\nThe label `no` is mapped to `1` and the label `yes` is mapped to `2`.\n\nHowever, since we are modeling the probability as a fraction that ranges from `0` to `1` we will need to subtract `1` from the converted values as follows:\n\n```{r}\nas.numeric(df$Coast) - 1\n```\n\n\nSo the label `no` is now mapped to `0` and the label `yes` is now mapped to `1`.\n\nNext, we'll plot the values while making sure to map the numeric representation of `Coast` to the y-axis (and not the x-axis).\n\n\n```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=as.numeric(df$Coast) - 1)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=.5) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, method.args = list(family=binomial)) + \n  ylab(\"Coast\") \n```\n\nThe logistic curve does not follow the complete sigmoid shape when limited to the original `Income` range. To see the full shape, we can increase the x-axis range using `xlim`, but this will also require that we instruct `stat_smooth` to extend the logistic curve to the new x-axis range by setting `fullrange` to `TRUE`.\n\n```{r, fig.height=1.8, fig.width=2.5}\nggplot(df, aes(x=Income, y=as.numeric(df$Coast) - 1)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=.5) +\n  stat_smooth(method=\"glm\", se=FALSE, fullrange=TRUE, \n              method.args = list(family=binomial)) + \n  ylab(\"Coast\") + xlim(10000, 40000)\n```\n\n\n# Assessing the fit with a pseudo R^2^\n\n> Note that even though many statistical software will compute a pseudo-R^2^ for logistic regression models, this measure of fit is not directly comparable to the R^2^ computed for linear regression models. In fact, some statisticians recommend avoiding publishing R^2^ since it can be misinterpreted in a logistic model context.\n\nTo assess how well a logistic model fits the data, we make use of the **log-likelihood** method (this is similar to the Pearson's correlation coefficient used with linear regression models). A *large* log-likelihood statistic indicates a poor fit (similar in idea to a large residual sum of squares statistic for a linear model). What we seek, therefore, is a *small* log-likelihood statistic. What constitutes a small or large statistic is determined by the log likelihood statistic of a base model (aka *null* model) where *none* of the predictive terms are added to he equation, i.e.:\n\n$$\np_{null} = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-(b_0)}}\n$$\n\nIn our working example, the log-likelihood statistic (often labeled as **-2LL** in some statistical packages) for the null model is,\n\n```{r}\nM1$null.deviance\n```\n\nWhat we want is -2LL for the full model (i.e. the model with the `Income` predictor variable) to be smaller than that of the null model. To extract -2LL from the model, type:\n\n```{r}\nM1$deviance\n```\n\nThis value is smaller than that of the null model--a good thing!\n\nThe difference between both log-likelihood values is referred to as the **model Chi-square**.\n\n```{r}\nmodelChi <- M1$null.deviance - M1$deviance\n```\n\nDividing the model Chi-square by the null log-likelihood value gives us one measure of the **pseudo R-square** (note that there is no exact way to compute the R-square value with a logistic regression model).\n\n```{r}\npseudo.R2 <- modelChi / M1$null.deviance\npseudo.R2\n```\n\nIn this working example, the model can account for `r round(pseudo.R2 * 100, 1)`% of the variability in the `Coast` variable. This pseudo R-square calculation is referred to as the **Hosmer and Lemeshow** R-square.\n\n## Alternative pseudo R^2^\n\nHere, we'll make use of the `rms` package's `lrm` function to compute another form of the pseudo R^2^ called the **Nagelkerke R^2^**.\n\n```{r}\nlrm(Coast ~ Income, df)\n```\n\nNote how this value of `r round(lrm(Coast ~ Income, df)$stats[\"R2\"],2)` differs from that of the *Hosmer and Lemeshow* R^2^ whose value is `r round(pseudo.R2,2)`.\n\n# Assessing the significance\n\n## Model significance\n\nA p-value for the logistic model can be approximated (note that it is difficult to associate an exact p-value with a logistic regression model).\n\nFirst, pull the the difference in degrees of freedom between the null and full model:\n\n```{r}\nChidf <- M1$df.null - M1$df.residual\n```\n\nThen, compute the p-value using the chi-square statistic. This pseudo p-value is also called the **likelihood ratio p-value**.\n\n```{r}\nchisq.prob <- 1 - pchisq(modelChi, Chidf)\nchisq.prob\n```\n\nIf the p-value is small then we can reject the null hypothesis that the current model does not improve on the base model. Here, the p-value is `r round(chisq.prob, 2)` suggesting that the model is a significant improvement over the base model.\n\n\n## Parameter significance \n\nIf we want to assess the significance of a parameter as it compares to the base model simply wrap the model object with the `summary` function.\n\n```{r}\nsummary(M1)\n```\n\nThe `Income` coefficient p-value is 0.036.  \n\n# Multi-variable model\n\nSo far, we've worked with a single variable model. We can augment the model by adding more variables. For example, we will add the fraction of the population that has attained a bachelor's degree to the model (we'll ignore the possibility of co-dependence between variables for pedagogical sake).\n\nThe entire workflow follows:\n\n```{r}\n# Grab variables of interest\ndf2 <- select(dat, Coast, Income = Per.capita.income, Edu = Fraction.with.Bachelor.s.or.greater)\n\n# Run regression model\nM2 <- glm(Coast ~ Income + Edu, df2, family = binomial)\n\n# Compute pseudo R-square\nmodelChi <- M2$null.deviance - M2$deviance\npseudo.R2 <- modelChi / M2$null.deviance\npseudo.R2\n\n# Compute the pseudo p-value\nChidf <- M2$df.null - M2$df.residual\nmodelChi <- M2$null.deviance - M2$deviance\n1 - pchisq(modelChi, Chidf)\n \n# Assess each parameter's significance\nsummary(M2)\n```\n\nNote the change in the `Income` coefficient p-value when adding another variable that may well be explaining the same variability in `Coast` (i.e. `Income` and `Edu` are very likely correlated).\n\n\n-----\n\n**Session Info**:\n\n```{r,results='asis', echo=FALSE}\n#detach(\"package:extrafont\")\npander::pander(sessionInfo(), locale = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":false,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"Logistic.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":false,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":["cosmo","custom.scss"],"minimal":true,"code-copy":"hover","anchor-sections":true,"title":"Logistic regression"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
